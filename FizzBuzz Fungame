rule 1:
number is divisible by 3 rather than print number its print Fizz
number is divisible by 5 rather than print number its print Buzz
number is divisible by both 3&5 rather than print number its print Fizzbuzz

for number in range(1,101):
  if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
  elif number % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
  elif number % 5 == 0:
    print ("Buzz")
  else:
    print(number)
